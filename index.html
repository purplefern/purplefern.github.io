<h1>Rodeo Flagellum</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> I don't know how I should signal myself. </p>
<p> Originally, I wasn't going to make this above remark, but
  I've now realized that this site partially exists to be read by others. </p>
<br>
<h2> Effective Altruism </h2>
<p> I identify with the Effective Altruism movement. </p>
<p> For those who are unfamiliar, EA is </p>
<blockquote> ...the project of (1) using evidence and reason to find the most promising causes to work on, and
(2) taking action, by using our time and money to do the most good we can.
</blockquote>
<p> I stay involved with EA since it generates research and discussions that interest me.</p>
<p> I believe that EA helps with or will likely help with improving contemporaneous well-being for humanity, improving
outcomes for posterity, maintaining civilizational stability, and reducing collective
sentient suffering. </p>

<br>

<h2> Forecasting </h2>
<p> I have been forecasting on the website Metaculus since June 2021.</p>
<p> I find estimating future outcomes entertaining. </p>
<p> I've enjoyed interacting with the forecasting community, and they've helped me to improve my forecasting. </p>
<p> My highest rank was/is 250 out ~10000 forecasters on Metaculus as of December 18th, 2021. </p>
<p> I believe my Metaculus rank is a weak signal for my forecasting accuracy. </p>
<p> The overwhelming majority of my forecasts are subjective estimates. </p>
<p> Many questions on Metaculus have point ranges that fail to measure forecasting skill adequately. </p>
<p> Many of my forecasts have been on such questions. </p>

<br>

<h2> Important Things </h2>
<p> These are things that I want to learn more about, work on, and/or monitor. </p>
<p> I have not thought deeply about the implications (especially the negative ones) of optimizing overwhelmingly for any one of these actions. </p>
<p> I have not thought deeply about how these actions should be prioritized. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li> Engendering as many scientific breakthroughs as possible; accelerating scientific progress </li>
<li> Making civilization as stable and sustainable as possible while simultaneously not limiting personal freedoms </li>
<li> Minimizing human death as much as possible, especially death by ageing </li>
<li> Digitally interpreting dreams, and being able to play them back </li>
<li> Enhancing humans to be significantly more intelligent, creative, motivated, moral, and/or rational (either genetically or post-birth) </li>
<li> Instituting a system of universal basic income as soon as possible </li>
<li> Creating emergent behavior in non-organic substrates </li>
<li> Accurately forecasting collective human behaviors </li>
<li> Modifying institutions, policy, governance, etc... to optimize for collective human well-being </li>
<li> Biologically reducing the sensations of suffering in humans </li>
<li> Controlling the Earth's climate with precision of a square kilometer </li>
<li> ML algorithms that actually learn, are robust etc... no shortcut learning </li>
</ul>

<!-- <h2> Reading List </h2>
<p> These are books or reports that I want to read. </p>
<p> Oftentimes, I have trouble adequately weighing the utility of non-book instruments against the utility of books for attaining my goals.</p>
<br>
<p> Statistical Rethinking (ed. 2); Bayesian Data Analysis (ed. 3); Rationality: A-Z; Gears of Aging; AGI Safety from First Principles;
Global Catastrophic Risk; Introduction to Statistical Decision Theory; Lifespan; On the Nature and Origins of Life on Earth;
Historical Dynamics; LessWrong 2018 Review; Where's My Flying Car?; The Great Conversation; Basic Principles of Nanotechnology;
Calculus (Spivak); The Precipice; (re-read) The Foundation Series; Synthetic Biology a Primer; Our Common Agenda; The Equation of
Knowledge; Valuing Health; What is Health?; The Science of Winning At Life  </p>

<!-- <h2> Analyzing Data </h2>
<p> This section is not yet rich with content. </p>
<p> I want to get better at handling data and diciphering signal from noise.</p>
<p> Ideally, this section will include reconducted analyses of data used in research, interpretations from
  varying statistical analyses, and discussions of existing and forthcoming statistical methods. </p>
<br> -->
