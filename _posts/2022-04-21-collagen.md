## [__What is Collagen?__](#collagen)
*This site exists because I made it*

hard insoluble fibrous protein
three key amino acids: glycine, proline, hydroxyproline
basically
collagen tripeptides and dipeptides can be digested orally
eight studies looking at collagen hydrolysates???
Greek word for glue / mesh
need vitamin C to metabolize collagen, needed to form collagen tightly, if not enough vitamin C, then leak blood, microhemmorage
amino acids bound together to make a triple helix of elongated "fibril" known as collagen helix
gelatin is irreversibly hydrolized collagen

## __Types of Collagen__

There are 28 types of collagen.
all types of collagen contain at least one triple helix
over 90% of the collagen in the human body is type I
fibrillar - type I, II, III, V, XI
non-fibrillar
-FACIT (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple Helices (Type IX, XII, XIV, XIX, XXI))
-short chain (Type VIII, X)
-basement membrane (type iv)
-multiplexin (multiple triple helix domains with interruptions (Type XV, XVIII))
-MACIT (Membrane Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple Helices (Type XIII, XVII))
-microfibril forming (Type VI)
-anchoring fibrils (Type VII)



Type I      Most abundant, 90%, scar tissues, tendons, ligaments, bones, teeth, skin, arteries
Type II     cartilage, joint cartilage,
Type III    connective tissue, mesh around the liver, inside the liver, inside the bone marrow and lymph, reticulate (main component of reticular fibers)
Type IV     respiratory tract, around the intestines, around the heart, lungs, basal lamina, basement membrane
Type V      hair, cell surfaces, placenta

Type I      Skin, Bone, Tendon (Non cartilage)
Type II     Cartilage, Vitreous humor
Type III    Extensible connective tissue (skin, lung, vascular system)
Type IV     Basement membrane
Type V      Along with Type-I
Type VI     Muscle
Type VII    Dermal epidermal junction
Type VIII   Endothelium
Type IX     Along with type II
Type X      Hypertrophic cartilage
Type XI     Along with type II
Type XII    Along with type I
Type XIII   NM Junction and skin
Type XIV    Along with type I
Type XV     Associated with collagens close to basement membranes
Type XVI    Many tissues
Type XVII   Epithelia, Skin hemidesmosomes
Type XVIII  Close structural homologue of XV
Type XIX    Rare, rhabdomyosarcoma
Type XX     Corneal epithelium
Type XXI    Many tissues
Type XXII   Tissue junctions
Type XXIII  Limited in tissues, mainly transmembrane and shed forms
Type XXIV   Developing cornea, Bone
Type XXV    Brain
Type XXVI   Testis, ovary
Type XXVII  Embryonic Cartilage
Type XXVIII BM Around Schwann cells
